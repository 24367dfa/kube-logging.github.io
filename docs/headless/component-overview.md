You can define `outputs` (destinations where you want to send your log messages, for example, Elasticsearch, or an Amazon S3 bucket), and `flows` that use filters and selectors to route log messages to the appropriate outputs. You can also define cluster-wide outputs and flows, for example, to use a centralized output that namespaced users can reference but cannot modify.

You can configure the Logging operator using the following Custom Resource Definitions.

- [logging]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/logging.md" >}}) - The `logging` resource defines the logging infrastructure for your cluster that collects and transports your log messages. It also contains configurations for Fluent Bit, Fluentd, and syslog-ng.
- CRDs for Fluentd:
    - [output]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/output.md" >}}) - Defines a Fluentd Output for a logging flow, where the log messages are sent using Fluentd. This is a namespaced resource. See also `clusteroutput`. To configure syslog-ng outputs, see `SyslogNGOutput`.
    - [flow]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/flow.md" >}}) - Defines a Fluentd logging flow using `filters` and `outputs`. Basically, the flow routes the selected log messages to the specified outputs. This is a namespaced resource. See also `clusterflow`. To configure syslog-ng flows, see `SyslogNGFlow`.
    - [clusteroutput]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/output.md" >}}) - Defines a Fluentd output that is available from all flows and clusterflows. The operator evaluates clusteroutputs in the `controlNamespace` only unless `allowClusterResourcesFromAllNamespaces` is set to true.
    - [clusterflow]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/flow.md" >}}) - Defines a Fluentd logging flow that collects logs from all namespaces by default. The operator evaluates clusterflows in the `controlNamespace` only unless `allowClusterResourcesFromAllNamespaces` is set to true. To configure syslog-ng clusterflows, see `SyslogNGClusterFlow`.
- CRDs for syslog-ng (these resources like their Fluentd counterparts, but are tailored to features available via syslog-ng):
    - [SyslogNGOutput]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/syslogngoutput.md" >}}) - Defines a syslog-ng Output for a logging flow, where the log messages are sent using Fluentd. This is a namespaced resource. See also `SyslogNGClusterOutput`. To configure Fluentd outputs, see `output`.
    - [SyslogNGFlow]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/syslogngflow.md" >}}) - Defines a syslog-ng logging flow using `filters` and `outputs`. Basically, the flow routes the selected log messages to the specified outputs. This is a namespaced resource. See also `SyslogNGClusterFlow`. To configure Fluentd flows, see `flow`.
    - [SyslogNGClusterOutput]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/syslogngoutput.md" >}}) - Defines a syslog-ng output that is available from all flows and clusterflows. The operator evaluates clusteroutputs in the `controlNamespace` only unless `allowClusterResourcesFromAllNamespaces` is set to true.
    - [SyslogNGClusterFlow]({{< relref "docs/logging-operator/configuration/syslogngflow.md" >}}) - Defines a syslog-ng logging flow that collects logs from all namespaces by default. The operator evaluates clusterflows in the `controlNamespace` only unless `allowClusterResourcesFromAllNamespaces` is set to true. To configure Fluentd clusterflows, see `clusterflow`.
